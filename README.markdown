DesktopSCRAM
============

A "SCRAM" button for my desktop.

Stops Banshee or iTunes from playing music (if it's running), and starts my screensaver.

Useful for grabbing a cup of coffee, or as a ZOMG-THE-BOSS-IS-BEHIND-ME button.

Uses a USB serial adapter and physical button to pull the DSR line to Ground to trigger.

I also remarked about this on my blog: http://www.mibus.org/2012/02/22/desktop-scram/
