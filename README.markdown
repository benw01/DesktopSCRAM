DesktopSCRAM
============

A "SCRAM" button for my desktop.

Stops Banshee from playing music (if it's running), and locks my screensaver.

Useful for grabbing a cup of coffee, or as a ZOMG-THE-BOSS-IS-BEHIND-ME button.

Uses a USB serial adapter and physical button to pull the DSR line to Ground to trigger.
